# Property-Price-Prediction-Model
Develop a machine learning model to predict property prices based on a comprehensive dataset of features describing property characteristics, design, location, and sale conditions. The goal is to provide accurate price predictions to assist homeowners, buyers, and real estate professionals in making informed decisions.


## Objective
Predict property prices based on various attributes to help stakeholders make informed decisions.

## Dataset Overview
- **Features:** 80+ attributes, including property characteristics, location, and transaction details.
- **Target Variable:** Sale_Price (property price in USD).

## Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding, scaling).
2. Feature Engineering and Selection.
3. Model Training and Evaluation (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.).
4. Hyperparameter Tuning and Optimization.
